how this one was deployed:

./launch.sh deploy-all # when in the current directory of the readme

after added the node starting with 13x.xxx.xx

and ran the 
./launch wg-mesh
./launch deploy

the clusted did not change
the config did not change
everything continued to work


for nex expansions / modifications change hosts in the inventory in the wg mesh and apply
next change the inventory of the k3s folder to conform to the change in wg mesh and done
